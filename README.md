Manish - Machine Learning Recommendation System. 
Content based recommendation system with Dummy dataset and ratings matrix in Google Colab using tensorflow.
Trained the model then Converted the Model into TFLite Format. Used CSV format dataset and modified.
Trained them using Python on Jupyter Notebook.
Used Logistic Regression's Sigmoid function for content based filtering and recommendation

Adhiraj - Object Detection.
Training the images for detection using tflite. recording the calories
Food Detection and Calorie Logging model that utilises MobileNetV2 SSD architecture on 14 different food classes.
Training dataset using Google's teachable machine learning.

Jasan - Integrated Android app, 12 steps for alcoholics.
Built an android app using Java, Firebase TensorFlow Lite
UI/UI design and built
Implemented the model trained on Object Detection and integrated with team members
Worked on finding the specific dataset for training

### This project was developed using Android Studio, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow Object Detection,etc.

Unzip the file and open the project in Android Studio. The Google Sign In was kept internal as this was not intended to share with everybody. Message our team members and we can invite you for the SHA1 login credentials. Go to:
> [Google Cloud Platform ](https://console.cloud.google.com)

Create a new credential and Copy the SHA1 ID from the SignInReport and paste it there. Save everything and you will now be able to log into the app.
Login using your AIT Google Account. You will be redirected to the Homepage, where 4 modules can be seen.

The profile is very basic and just displays your username fetched from the SHA1 key.

Calorie Counter redirects you to the Calorie Log of the day. Press the camera button below to use the Food detecting feature. The camera can detect upto 15 food classes and add calories respectively.

For the Object Detection, we used Tensorflow Lite's framework and using Google's Teachable Machine to train the tflite dataset.

The substances module consists of several substances such as Opiates, Benzos, Alcohol and so on, with their respective information. 

The 12 Steps consists of a 12 Step program summary created by the Alcohol Anonymous.
